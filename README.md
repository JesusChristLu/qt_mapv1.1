# qt_mapv1.1
Three method of mapping between quantum circuit and quantum hardware.
1)A very simple method, which only consider the shortest path length between each logical bits. Swap through the connection matrix to each
shortest mapping.
2)Using Deep Q Learning.
3)Combine the Monto Carlo Tree Search, Reinforcement Learning and Residual Network.
